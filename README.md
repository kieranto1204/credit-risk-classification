Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to create a model that would identify the creditworthiness of borrowers, based on a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer to peer lending service company.

The Results:
- Accuracy Score: The accuracy score is total proportion of correct classifications comapared to the total classifications (positive and negative).
- Precision Score: The precision score is the total proportion of classifications correctly classified as positives, compared to the actual total of positive classifications, in this case the model scored an unweighted average of 92%.
- Recall Score: The recall score is the total proportion of  correctly classified positives compared to the amount of actual positive classifications, in this case the model scored an unweighted average of 94%.

A Summary:
Based on the model's high accuracy, precision, and recall scores (all over 90%), I would reccomend that the company use this model in their peer-to-peer lending service. This model has shown to be very accurate when it comes to loan repayment and could likely even be tweaked to become more accurate as more data is collected on loan repayment.
